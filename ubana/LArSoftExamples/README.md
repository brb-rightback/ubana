# LArSoft Examples

These modules are intended to be used as reference example for MicroBooNE 
analyzers which are new to writing and using LArSoft modules. 

These examples come with a few qualifiers:
* I am not a cpp guru
* These examples are not sanctioned by the LArSoft team

These modules have been tested against the current state-of-the-art
uboonecode release, v07_04_00, and they seem to work.

This is really only going over the basics you need to start working on 
analysis, but the best way to learn LArSoft is by reading code 
other people have written in the past.

Feel free to add additional examples to this directory!
